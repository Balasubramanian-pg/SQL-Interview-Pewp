Here's the complete `INSERT INTO` query to populate the `user_activity` table for testing time difference analysis between user events:

```sql
-- Create user_activity table if it doesn't exist
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_activity (
    user_identifier VARCHAR(50),
    event_type VARCHAR(20),
    event_date TIMESTAMP
);

-- Clear existing data (if any)
TRUNCATE TABLE user_activity;

-- Insert sample data with various user activity patterns
INSERT INTO user_activity (user_identifier, event_type, event_date) VALUES
-- User A: Regular activity with consistent intervals
('userA', 'login', '2024-01-01 08:00:00'),
('userA', 'logout', '2024-01-01 17:30:00'),
('userA', 'login', '2024-01-02 08:15:00'),
('userA', 'purchase', '2024-01-02 12:30:00'),
('userA', 'logout', '2024-01-02 18:00:00'),
('userA', 'login', '2024-01-05 09:00:00'),  -- 3 day gap
('userA', 'logout', '2024-01-05 17:45:00'),

-- User B: Infrequent activity with long gaps
('userB', 'login', '2024-01-01 10:00:00'),
('userB', 'purchase', '2024-01-15 14:00:00'),  -- 14 day gap
('userB', 'logout', '2024-01-15 18:00:00'),
('userB', 'login', '2024-02-01 11:00:00'),  -- 17 day gap

-- User C: Multiple events in one day
('userC', 'login', '2024-01-10 07:30:00'),
('userC', 'purchase', '2024-01-10 09:15:00'),
('userC', 'logout', '2024-01-10 16:45:00'),
('userC', 'login', '2024-01-10 19:00:00'),  -- Same day
('userC', 'logout', '2024-01-10 22:30:00'),
('userC', 'login', '2024-01-12 08:00:00'),  -- 1 day gap (next calendar day)

-- User D: Only one event (shouldn't appear in results)
('userD', 'login', '2024-01-05 12:00:00'),

-- User E: Irregular activity pattern
('userE', 'login', '2024-01-03 09:00:00'),
('userE', 'purchase', '2024-01-07 15:30:00'),  -- 4 day gap
('userE', 'logout', '2024-01-07 16:00:00'),
('userE', 'login', '2024-01-08 10:00:00'),  -- 1 day gap
('userE', 'purchase', '2024-01-20 11:00:00'),  -- 12 day gap
('userE', 'logout', '2024-01-20 17:00:00');
```

To test the time difference between user events:

```sql
WITH ranked_events AS (
  SELECT
    user_identifier,
    event_date,
    LAG(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY user_identifier ORDER BY event_date) AS previous_event_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_identifier ORDER BY event_date DESC) AS event_rank
  FROM user_activity
),
time_differences AS (
  SELECT
    user_identifier,
    event_date,
    previous_event_date,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (event_date - previous_event_date))/86400 AS days_elapsed
  FROM ranked_events
  WHERE previous_event_date IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
  user_identifier,
  event_date AS most_recent_event,
  previous_event_date AS second_last_event,
  ROUND(days_elapsed, 2) AS days_between_events,
  CASE
    WHEN days_elapsed < 1 THEN 'Less than 1 day'
    WHEN days_elapsed BETWEEN 1 AND 7 THEN '1-7 days'
    WHEN days_elapsed BETWEEN 7 AND 30 THEN '1-4 weeks'
    ELSE 'Over 1 month'
  END AS time_gap_category
FROM time_differences
WHERE event_rank = 1  -- Only compare most recent to second-to-last event
ORDER BY user_identifier;
```

Key features of this test data:
1. **Multiple user patterns** (regular, infrequent, bursty activity)
2. **Various time gaps** (same day, days, weeks between events)
3. **Edge cases** (user with only one event)
4. **Different event types** (login, logout, purchase)
5. **Mixed intraday and multi-day intervals**

The solution should:
- Correctly calculate time differences between consecutive events
- Handle same-day events properly (showing fractional days)
- Exclude users with only one event
- Categorize time gaps meaningfully
- Sort results by user identifier

Alternative solution for databases with different date functions:

```sql
-- For SQL Server
WITH ranked_events AS (
  SELECT
    user_identifier,
    event_date,
    LAG(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY user_identifier ORDER BY event_date) AS previous_event_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_identifier ORDER BY event_date DESC) AS event_rank
  FROM user_activity
)
SELECT
  user_identifier,
  event_date AS most_recent_event,
  previous_event_date AS second_last_event,
  DATEDIFF(DAY, previous_event_date, event_date) AS days_between_events,
  DATEDIFF(HOUR, previous_event_date, event_date)/24.0 AS precise_days
FROM ranked_events
WHERE previous_event_date IS NOT NULL
  AND event_rank = 1
ORDER BY user_identifier;

-- For MySQL
WITH ranked_events AS (
  SELECT
    user_identifier,
    event_date,
    LAG(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY user_identifier ORDER BY event_date) AS previous_event_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_identifier ORDER BY event_date DESC) AS event_rank
  FROM user_activity
)
SELECT
  user_identifier,
  event_date AS most_recent_event,
  previous_event_date AS second_last_event,
  TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, previous_event_date, event_date) AS days_between_events,
  TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, previous_event_date, event_date)/24.0 AS precise_days
FROM ranked_events
WHERE previous_event_date IS NOT NULL
  AND event_rank = 1
ORDER BY user_identifier;
```

Additional analysis queries you might want to test:

```sql
-- Average time between events by user
SELECT
  user_identifier,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (event_date - previous_event_date))/86400 AS avg_days_between_events,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM (
  SELECT
    user_identifier,
    event_date,
    LAG(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY user_identifier ORDER BY event_date) AS previous_event_date
  FROM user_activity
) t
WHERE previous_event_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY user_identifier
ORDER BY avg_days_between_events DESC;

-- Time between specific event types (e.g., login to purchase)
SELECT
  user_identifier,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (purchase_date - login_date))/3600 AS hours_to_purchase
FROM (
  SELECT
    user_identifier,
    event_date AS login_date,
    LEAD(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY user_identifier ORDER BY event_date) AS purchase_date,
    event_type,
    LEAD(event_type) OVER (PARTITION BY user_identifier ORDER BY event_date) AS next_event_type
  FROM user_activity
) t
WHERE event_type = 'login' AND next_event_type = 'purchase';
```
