**SQL Schema**

```Plain
Table: orders
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| order_id    | int     |
| item_id     | int     |

```

Write a query to return the product groups in the **US** that have no sales of any unit.

So I have to select the product group from catalog table where location is US and quantity is 0

  

```SQL
SELECT c.product_group,
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN catalog c on o.item_id = c.item_id
WHERE o.quantity IS NULL AND c.location = 'US'
```

  

**Example**

Write a query to **return the product names** that were ordered during the last 1 week. Order by product name ASC.

I need to return product names from product table, where order date is last 1 week

I have to order by product name ascending

FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN product p ON o.product_id = p.product_id

==**A complex Problem**==

This problem requires handling three cases:

1. Get the **latest status** for each customer at the **end of each month** in 2019.
2. If multiple records exist for a month, pick the **latest event_date** in that month.
3. If no records exist for a month, use the **latest prior record**.

---

### **Solution Approach**

1. **Generate a list of all months in 2019**.
2. **Find the latest record for each customer in each month**.
3. **Use a window function to carry forward the latest status from previous months if no record exists for a month**.

---

### **SQL Query**

```SQL
WITH MonthList AS (
    -- Generate all months in 2019
    SELECT DATEFROMPARTS(2019, num, 1) AS month_start
    FROM (VALUES (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12)) AS months(num)
),
RankedData AS (
    -- Assign row numbers based on latest event_date per customer per month
    SELECT
        c.customer_id,
        DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(c.event_date), MONTH(c.event_date), 1) AS month_start,
        c.event_date,
        c.status,
        c.credit_limit,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY c.customer_id, YEAR(c.event_date), MONTH(c.event_date)
                           ORDER BY c.event_date DESC) AS rn
    FROM customer_data c
    WHERE YEAR(c.event_date) = 2019
),
LatestPerMonth AS (
    -- Get the latest event within each month
    SELECT customer_id, month_start, event_date, status, credit_limit
    FROM RankedData
    WHERE rn = 1
),
AllMonths AS (
    -- Create a full dataset with all months per customer
    SELECT DISTINCT c.customer_id, m.month_start
    FROM customer_data c
    CROSS JOIN MonthList m
),
FinalData AS (
    -- Combine the actual monthly data and fill missing months with latest available data
    SELECT
        a.customer_id,
        a.month_start,
        l.event_date,
        l.status,
        l.credit_limit,
        -- Assign a ranking to pick the latest prior data if no exact match is found
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY a.customer_id, a.month_start ORDER BY l.event_date DESC) AS rn
    FROM AllMonths a
    LEFT JOIN LatestPerMonth l
        ON a.customer_id = l.customer_id
        AND l.month_start <= a.month_start
)
-- Pick the latest available record
SELECT customer_id, month_start, event_date, status, credit_limit
FROM FinalData
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY customer_id, month_start;
```

---

### **Explanation**

1. `**MonthList**`: Creates a list of months from January to December 2019.
2. `**RankedData**`: Assigns a rank to pick the latest event for each month.
3. `**LatestPerMonth**`: Extracts the most recent event per customer per month.
4. `**AllMonths**`: Ensures every customer has all 12 months available.
5. `**FinalData**`: Joins data with `LatestPerMonth`, carrying forward the last known status if missing.
6. **Final** `**SELECT**`: Picks the latest available record for each month.

---

### **Handling Edge Cases**

✔️ If a customer has multiple records in a month → **Picks the latest date**.

✔️ If a month has no record → **Uses the latest available prior record**.

✔️ If no prior record exists → **Data remains NULL** (Can be handled with a default value).

🚀 **This ensures an accurate, gap-free status report for all months in 2019!** 🚀

Here are the answers to the questions you faced in your phone interview rounds:

---

### **Data Engineering Questions**

### **1. What is partitioning?**

Partitioning is the process of dividing a large dataset into smaller, more manageable parts (partitions) to improve query performance. It reduces the amount of data scanned by queries by filtering based on partition columns.

### **2. What is the difference between OLAP vs. OLTP?**

- **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**: Used for analytics and reporting. It involves complex queries on large datasets and is optimized for reading and aggregations. Example: Data warehouses.
- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**: Used for real-time transactional workloads. It involves frequent read-write operations on normalized databases. Example: Banking systems.

### **3. What is a cube?**

A cube (OLAP cube) is a multi-dimensional data structure that allows fast retrieval of aggregated data for analytical queries. It precomputes aggregations and stores data in multiple dimensions (e.g., sales by region, product, and time).

### **4. What are the file formats used in Hadoop?**

Common Hadoop file formats include:

- **Text-based**: CSV, JSON, XML
- **Binary**: Avro, ORC, Parquet
- **Sequence Files**: Used for key-value pair storage in Hadoop

### **5. What is partitioning in Hive?**

Partitioning in Hive organizes tables into partitions based on column values (e.g., `year=2023, month=01`). It improves query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned.

### **6. What are the different compression formats in Hive?**

Common Hive compression formats include:

- **Gzip (.gz)**
- **Snappy** (fastest, used in Parquet/ORC)
- **Bzip2 (.bz2)**
- **LZO (Splittable, used in HDFS for large data)**

---

### **SQL Questions**

### **7. Find the top-selling items (SQL query).**

```SQL
SELECT product_id, SUM(units_sold) AS total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This finds the top-selling item based on total units sold.

### **8. Sum of an array in SQL (assuming an array column in PostgreSQL).**

```SQL
SELECT id, SUM(unnest(array_column)) AS total_sum
FROM table_name
GROUP BY id;
```

For databases without array support, you'd need to normalize the data.

### **9. Sum of two numbers (SQL query).**

```SQL
SELECT num1 + num2 AS sum FROM table_name;
```

If using variables:

```SQL
SELECT 5 + 10 AS sum;
```

---

### **Behavioral Questions**

### **10. What is tracing?**

Tracing is a debugging and monitoring technique used to track requests as they flow through a system. It's common in distributed systems (e.g., OpenTelemetry, AWS X-Ray) to trace API calls and latency issues.

### **11. What best practice compromise did you make to deliver a product on time?**

Example Answer:

_"In one project, we had a strict deadline for launching a data pipeline. The best practice was to implement full data validation at every stage, but it would have delayed the release. Instead, we prioritized critical checks and implemented a post-deployment monitoring system to identify anomalies. This allowed us to meet the deadline while ensuring data integrity over time."_

Hi folks, just wanna share a few sql questions I had on a recent Amazon Data Scientist phone interview

there are 2 tables: STREAMS and TITLES

```SQL
STREAMS table
USER_ID
TITLE_ID
STREAM_TIMESTART
STREAM_MINUTES
Key for this table is (USER_ID,TITLE_ID,STREAM_TIMESTART)

TITLES table

TITLE_ID
GENRE
NAME
LAUNCH_DATE

Key for this table is TITLE_ID
```

1. Find the number of times of each movie (title) was streamed and the total minutes streamed and the movie's genre in the month of December 2018.  
    My solution: Straightforward  
    `join` and `group by`
2. Find the name and title id of the first movie streamed by each user each day.  
    My solution: Window function parition by  
    `USER_ID` and `date(STREAM_TIMESTART)` and order by `STREAM_TIMESTART` here, taking `row_number()==1`.
3. Find the total minutes streamed for each movie within the first 28 days since the movie's launch date.  
    My solution: I did a  
    `join` with a filter `LAUNCH_DATE + INTERVAL 28 DAYS >= date(STREAM_TIMESTART)` here but the interviewer did not seemed to like/understand this  
    approach and kept asking me for an alternative approach. I guess he  
    found it unintuitive? Anyone else got another idea please?
