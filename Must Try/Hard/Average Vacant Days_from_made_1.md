- **1.** **Identify active listings:**
    
    Filter the listings table to include only those that are currently active (is_active = 1).
    
- **2.** **Calculate rented days:**
    
    For each active listing, calculate the number of days it was rented out within the specified year (e.g., 2021). This involves joining the listings and bookings tables and considering the check-in and check-out dates.
    
- **3.** **Calculate vacant days:**
    
    Subtract the rented days from 365 (or the total number of days in the year) to find the number of vacant days for each listing.
    
- **4.** **Calculate average vacant days:**
    
    Calculate the average of the vacant days across all active listings.
    
- **5.** **Handle edge cases:**
    
    Consider scenarios where a listing might have check-in or check-out dates outside the specified year by appropriately adjusting the date calculations.
